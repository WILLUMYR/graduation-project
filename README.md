This is our graduation project for School of Applied techonology. During a period of two weeks we did two sprints to complete this project.

# Purpose of project
This is  an easy-to-use platform that can be used by organizations to provide mental health support for human traffic victims. The application currently supports two types of users: patients and psychologists. Patients can anonymously register, login and leave a message (create a case) for a mental health specialist and close the case at any time. Psychologists must already be in a system in order to login, work with cases, write notes and answer/talk to patients. The conversation between two parties works like a chat.

# Tech Stack 
We're using:
* Node / Express backend 
* React / TypeScript frontend
-> Linter using airbnb standard with again with typescript on the frontend. 

* Authentication is built with an auth middleware and JWT.

* Testing with mongodb-memory-server 
For integration testing our endpoints we used a module called mongodb-memory-server which allows us to run tests on your a simulated mongodb database on your machine instead of a remote mockdatabase.
